# Go Module Import Path Fix Summary

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
module p9_microstream@latest found (v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000, replaced by ./), but does not contain package p9_microstream/pkg/broadcaster
```

## Root Cause
The Go module was named `p9_microstream` but the actual directory structure and import paths were inconsistent, causing build failures on Railway's Linux environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated go.mod
- Changed module name from `p9_microstream` to `pulseintel`
- Removed the replace directive that was causing confusion
- Kept all dependencies intact

### 2. Fixed Import Paths
Updated import paths in the following files:
- `cmd/main.go` - Main application imports
- `internal/analytics/historical_realtime_fusion.go`
- `internal/analytics/book_ticker_aggregator.go`
- `internal/analytics/historical_data_fetcher.go`
- `internal/analytics/insurance_fund_monitor.go`
- `internal/analytics/multi_timeframe_coordinator.go`
- `internal/analytics/ohlcv_candle_generator.go`
- `internal/analytics/orderbook_analyzer.go`
- `internal/analytics/order_flow_analyzer.go`
- `internal/analytics/periodic_snapshot_generator.go`
- `internal/analytics/redis_publish_confirmer.go`
- `internal/detectors/mean_reversion.go`
- `internal/detectors/momentum.go`
- `internal/detectors/spoofing.go`
- `internal/exchanges/bybit.go`
- `pkg/broadcaster/broadcaster.go`

### 3. Import Path Changes
All imports changed from:
```go
"p9_microstream/internal/config"
"p9_microstream/internal/events"
"p9_microstream/pkg/broadcaster"
```

To:
```go
"pulseintel/internal/config"
"pulseintel/internal/events"
"pulseintel/pkg/broadcaster"
```

## Verification
- ✅ Local build successful: `go build -o test_build.exe ./cmd/main.go`
- ✅ Railway-style build successful: `go build -ldflags='-w -s -extldflags "-static"' -a -installsuffix cgo -o pulseintel_engine ./cmd/main.go`
- ✅ All import paths resolved correctly
- ✅ No remaining references to old module name

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to GitHub repository
3. Trigger Railway deployment
4. The Go service should now build successfully on Railway

## Files Modified
- `go.mod` - Updated module name and removed replace directive
- 16 Go source files - Updated import paths to match new module name
